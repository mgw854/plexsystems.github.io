While REST APIs make sense for many of these services, it does not make sense for all of them. For some domains, such as EDI, that require many endpoints, performance, and maintenance concerns start to become a problem. Every API call is a round-trip from the client to the server, impacting the overall performance of the initial request.</description></item></channel></rss>
